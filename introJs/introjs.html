                    <h1>An Introduction to JavaScipt</h1>
                    <p>
                        Let's see what's so special about JavaScipt, what can achive with it, and what other
                        technologies play well with it.
                    </p>

                <div>
                    <h2>What is Javascipt</h2>
                    <p><i>JavaScipt</i> was initially created to "make pages alive".</p>    
                    <p>The program in this language are called <i>scripts</i>. They can be written right in a web page's HTML and run
                        automatically as the pages loads.
                    </p>
                    <p>Scripts are provided as plain text. They don't need special preparation or complication to run</p>
                    <p>In this aspect JavaScipt is very different from another language called <a href="#">Java</a></p>
                    <div class="boxPara">
                        <p>
                            When JavaScipt was created, initially had another name: "LiveScript". But Java was very popular at that time,
                            so it was decided that positioning a new language as  a "younger brother " of Java would help.                            
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But as it evolved, JavaScipt became a fully independent language with its own specification called
                            <a href="#">ECMAScript</a>, and now it has no relation to Java at all.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Today JavaScipt can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server, or actually on any device that has
                        a special program called <a href="#">the JavaScipt engine.</a>
                    </p>
                    <div class="boxPara">
                       <h3>How do engines work</h3>
                       <p>Engines are compicated but basics are easy.</p>
                       <ol>
                            <li>The engine (embedded if it's a browser) reads ("parse") the script.</li>
                            <li>Then it converts ("compiles") the script to the machine language.</li>
                            <li>And then the machine code runs, pretty fast.</li>
                       </ol>
                       <p>
                            The engine applies optimizations at each step of the process. It even watches
                            the compiled script as it runs, analyzes the data that flows through it, and further optimizes the machine 
                            code based on that knowledge.
